          I Know I am not beside you abhi physically but I am always there for you.
          Your presence colors my world with joy and warmth. Rose was the first 
          thing i ever gave u with my hands . The red rose was something I wanted to 
          give you for so long. That rose lit up your face and that made me soo happy.
          And then you handed me that letter ðŸ¤­.I love you soo much ðŸ’–.
          Thank you for being my source of love and inspiration. Our journey
          together is as sweet as the fragrance of roses. Happy Rose Day, Ekuu.
